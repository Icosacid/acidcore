#Acidcore

Some of the core files I use for several applications.

## JavaScript
* spreadSVG.js, a graphic library for random generative art in the DOM
* zoomCheat.js, zooming script to fit any web content with fixed dimensions to the whole window
* jAntispam.js, encrypting function to avoid displaying raw e-mail addresses in the DOM

## CSS

* To be continued...
